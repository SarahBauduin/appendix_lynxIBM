# R code to run a spatially-explicit individual-based model (IBM) for the Eurasian lynx

This is an appendix of a manuscript currently in review (preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.22.465393v1)) entitled: "Eurasian lynx populations in Western Europe: What prospects for the next 50 years?".

The **LICENSE** file gives the terms to reuse the model.

The **module** folder contains 3 folders: **inputs**, **lynxIBM** and **outputs**.

The folder **inputs** contains all the input files to run the lynx spatially explicit individual-based model (SE-IBM).
In this folder there are: 
- **collProb.tif** is a raster layer of the collision probabilities (see Appendix A of the publication).
- **countryBorders.shp** is a shapefile of the country borders (France, Germany, Switzerland which are the country we focused on)
- **fourPop.tif** is a raster layer of the population area (see Appendix A of the publication).
- **habMap.tif** is a raster layer of the different habitats for the lynx (see Appendix A of the publication).
- **listLynxInitPop.RData** is a list of 500 different initial lynx populations (see Appendix A of the publication).

In the folder **lynxIBM** there are:
- **lynxIBM.R** is the code of the lynx SE-IBM.
- **lynxIBM.Rmd** is the code to run the lynx SE-IBM. This code runs the model once and simulate lynx populations for 50 years.

In the folder **outputs** there are:
- a **cache** folder
- 200 simulation outputs of the SE-IBM.


The **analyzeResults.R** code takes the 200 simulation outputs from the "module" folder and analyze them, producing the results and figures in the publication.
